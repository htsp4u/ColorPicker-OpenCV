# ColorPicker-OpenCV

A python program to detect color picked.

Takes input from webcam. 5 windows will open. The "Main" window is where you click on what color you would like to filter for. The other 3 image windows are for showing only the color picked and then some extra stuff which helps with many different OpenCV applications. The last window has a slider that allows you to change the tolerance of values that will show up (based upon where you clicked last).

Required packages:
- Numpy
- OpenCV
